Recently I took an introduction to computer networking class that went through the network layers from a top-down approach.
It really opened my eyes up to the importance of networking and how it all interconnects with technology.
For me it seemed that software engineering is about the future of technology the **"edge"** of tech, while Networking is the **foundation** of technology and is what allows everything to sit on top of it.

Not only have I seen a rise in cybersecurity/networking jobs in the industry, it is also not the most popular option which means that there is less competition.

While software-engineering seems to have slowed down, it's still the most popular option and will continue to be a very large part of the future.
I still want to learn the skills to create software as it is a very valuable skill, while also being able to create my own applications or websites for whatever purpose I need.

Networking and Cybersecurity continue to become more important as the world becomes more invested in technology.
I saw a government program for a masters in cybersecurity, and there seems to be a desire for both a computer science and cybersecurity degree.
- As the internet continues to grow and technology becomes more advanced, networking to keep everything connected, and cybersecurity to protect various attributes of technology will undoubtedly become more important.

As is with google recommended, I have seen various articles such as the demand for cybersecurity, IT, or cloud technology skills have become more prevalent.

I've gotten an IT job at my university and also am studying for the CCNA, not only to get the CCNA, but also the knowledge that is required.
In doing so it has reignited my eagerness to learn and also how important it is to have a career that you are invested in.
Learning about IPv4 addresses, TCP and UDP protocols have really me break down why technology is so important and how intuitive most of it seems.
