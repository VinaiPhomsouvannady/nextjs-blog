These past few months have really awakened my mind to what is important to me.
Balance in almost everything has really opened my eyes in how beneficial it can be.

Various things such as eating healthy, exercising my body, and taking care of my own mental health and learning more about myself have become more important for me.

- Health
- Food
- Exercise
- Mental Health/Self-Care
- Spirituality
- Career
- Relationships
- Skills/Hobbies

Trying to balance a healthy life-style while also trying to progress in whatever it may be such as relationships, or a career can be difficult however none of it needs to be perfect immediately.
Life is more about the slow journey of life and finding fulfillment from whatever I do more than simple pleasure.

When other parts of my life are good I find that I am more successful in other things that I try to do.
Its like building a strong foundation for life will help me with other various aspects that I try such as learning more about Networking. 

Instead of forcing myself to learn networking just for the money, enjoying other aspects of my life has allowed me to study networking in a more positive fashion.
It reminds me to take pride in the knowledge that I know and the value of knowledge.
It helps me value habit and dedication, more than short-term value.

My perspective on money has also changed as I value the experiences that I can get more than just the money, however I do want the stability that comes with having "enough" money.
