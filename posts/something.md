Some time from the future that exists now.

I like to express personality into my personal projects.

Not only do I find it enriching to the learning experience it also helps express creativity
and possible ideas that I could implement to humor myself while also improving my skills
- Creating more blog posts
- Implementing tic-tac-toe
- Customizing the 404 page.
- Enjoyment from the process.

You should ask yourself: "Am i enjoying this?"
If not then ask yourself: "How can I make myself enjoy this?"

OR JUST DO IT!!!

Which is okay but not very good for long-term.
