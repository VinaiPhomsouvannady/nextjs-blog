Trying new things is interesting but also difficult.

I like to try new things

- Food
- Fashion/Art
- Perspectives
- Ideas
- Skills
- Technologies
- Expressions of Art
- Music 
- Cooking


I think that it is very important to try new things
Don't get me wrong I like to keep the same routine however I think that something new everyday can enrich one's lifestyle.
Also I want to learn more so that I can do better and possibly earn a living from my skills.

Trying new things is also difficult because of failure.
Trying new things and failing is very disheartening **but** if you truly want to learn then failure is your best teacher.
